# An online course in basic statistics from scratch

This is an index and information page for a set of videos on introductory statistics, in particular a course in introductory frequentist statistics for absolute beginners, including those with an apprehension towards anything that appears mathematical.

This course was designed for students in special needs education at the University of Oslo, many of whom have absolutely no background in statistics or any mathematics beyond middle school.
The course relies heavily on simulations and visual demonstrations and explains everything from scratch, building up a solid  nonmathematical foundation toward understanding the three main pillars of introductory statistical testing: the chi-square test of proportions, t-tests, and bivariate correlations. A brief follow-up introduces the very basics of oneway ANOVA, interactions, and simple linear regression. In the course we use the Jamovi software, which can be downloaded for free from jamovi.org. 

If you know nothing about statistics -- and maybe are a little afraid of it -- but need to learn some, or are just curious, this course is for you!

# A bit about the teaching approach

This course applies the opposite of a "recipe" approach.  Instead of a list of choices for instructions to click on menu items, and superficial rules for choosing among them, I actually try to explain the foundational concepts behind frequentist inferential statistics, and build up to a small set of very basic analyses.  My idea is that if you understand this then you will also be able understand more advanced extensions as you need them, because the principles are the same.  If you are looking with "easy to follow" lists of instructions, this course is not for you.  If you are looking for a simplified but valid understanding of what we do and why, that can help you both conduct and interpret statistical tests, then please read on.

The material I have chosen to present is selected according to two main criteria: First, what should students be able to understand and achieve by the end of the course? The answer is, a few basic analyses, so they can read simple articles and write a master's thesis using a quantitative analysis method, as well as standard scores, because of their importance in testing.  Second, what do they need to know in order to understand these things?  I have created a sequence of topics that builds up toward this goal, and have only included those concepts and issues that I consider necessary for reaching the goal, often omitting material that may be "standard" in introductory statistics courses  but in my opinion not critical for the basic understanding I aim for. The sequence of lectures is very important, as they build on previous material to advance understanding toward the goal.  It is not at all advisable to watch the videos out of order, because you will probably lack the background to understand (and perhaps because I may be building on a specially simplified approach I have presented before).

Note that, in order to make the material as palatable as possible to students with a possible aversion to anything with numbers, I have not only used a lot of visual explanation, but I have also cut corners whenever possible. I have chosen the simplest possible cases to explain in depth, simplified further whenever possible, and I have omitted all detail that I consider unnecessary for grasping the basic concepts. I have pared down the introductory material to its bare essentials, stopping just short of saying something wrong. If you want more information and more detail, you are advised to follow up on these basic explanations with a textbook. I can wholeheartedly recommend [Learning statistics with Jamovi](https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/), a textbook that is freely available on the web, with the added advantage of using the same software (which is easy to use, available online, and will likely cover all your needs).  You can also consult [Statistical thinking for the 21st century](https://statsthinking21.org/) for a different take, also very modern and still from the ground up and freely available on the web.

| 0a  | [Why YOU should learn statistics](https://youtu.be/XkgO_RMku-A) |  In this video I explain why it is useful -- no, absolutely necessary! -- for students of special needs education to be able to understand basic statistics. (If you are not into special education this may not apply to you.) |
| 0b  | [What statistics is (and why)](https://youtu.be/XXNLp1utf6g) |  In this video I explain what we mean by "statistics" in the context of research and practice in special needs education. (This approach is probably relevant even if you are not into special education.) |
